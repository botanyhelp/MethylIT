#' Simulated dataset of potential DMPs used in examples
#'
#' Each individuals sample includes 10000 cytosine positions
#'
#' @format PS is an object from class "pDMP" carrying in the meta-columns the
#'     following variables:
#'     \describe{
#'         \item{p1}{methylation level from the reference sample}
#'         \item{p2}{methylation level from the treatment sample}
#'         \item{TV}{the total variation distance (difference of
#'                 methylation levels)}
#'         \item{hdiv}{Hellinger divergence}
#'         \\item{wprob}{the probabilities:
#'               \eqn{wprob = 1 - CDF probability}}
#'     }

#'     'PS' is an object from class "pDMP" carrying the same meta-columns as
#'     'HD' (dataset) plus the probilities: \eqn{wprob = 1 - Weibull
#'     probability}. 'PS' was obtained with function
#'     \code{\link{getPotentialDIMP}}.
