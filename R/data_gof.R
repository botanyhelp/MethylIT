#' Simulated dataset of nonlinear fits used in the examples
#'
#' Each individuals sample includes 10000 cytosine positions
#'
#' @format gof is a list of best fitted nonlinear probability distribution
#'     model estimated for the dataset 'HD' (available in MethylIT package)
#'     'gof' carries the information on the best fitted probability
#'     distribution model for each individual sample. 'gof' was obtained with
