#' @title  Unique GRanges of methylation read counts filtered by coverages
#' @description Given two GRanges objects, samples '1' and '2', this function
#'     will filter by coverage each cytosine site from each GRanges object.
#' @details Cytosine sites with 'coverage' > 'min.coverage' in at least one of
#'     the samples are preserved. Positions with 'coverage' < 'min.coverage' in
#'     both samples, 'x' and 'y', are removed. Positions with 'coverage' >
#'     'percentile' (e.g., 99.9 percentile) are removed as well. It is expected
#'     that the columns of methylated and unmethylated counts are given.
#' @param x An object from the classes 'GRanges', 'InfDiv', or 'pDMP' with
#'     methylated and unmethylated counts in its meta-column. If the argument
#'     'y' is not given, then it is assumed that the first four columns of the
#'     GRanges metadata 'x' are counts: methylated and unmethylated counts for
#'     samples '1' and '2'.
#' @param y A GRanges object with methylated and unmethylated counts in its
#'     meta-column. Default is NULL. If x is a 'InfDiv', or 'pDMP', then 'y' is
#'     not needed, since samples '1' and '2' are the first four columns of these
#'     objects.
#' @param min.coverage An integer or an integer vector of length 2. Cytosine
#'     sites where the coverage in both samples, 'x' and 'y', are less than
#'     'min.coverage' are discarded. The cytosine site is preserved, however, if
#'     the coverage is greater than 'min.coverage'in at least one sample. If
#'     'min.coverage' is an integer vector, then the corresponding min coverage
#'     is applied to each sample.
#' @param min.meth An integer or an integer vector of length 2. Cytosine sites
#'     where the numbers of read counts of methylated cytosine in both samples,
#'     '1' and '2', are less than 'min.meth' are discarded. If 'min.meth' is an
#'     integer vector, then the corresponding min number of reads is applied to
#'     each sample.
#' @param min.umeth An integer or an integer vector of length 2. Min number of
#'     reads to consider cytosine position. Specifically cytosine positions
#'     where (uC <= min.umeth) & (mC > 0) & (mC < min.meth) hold will be
#'     removed, where mC and uC stand for the numbers of methylated and
#'     unmethylated reads. Default is min.umeth = 0.
#' @param percentile Threshold to remove the outliers from each file and all
#'     files stacked.
#' @param high.coverage An integer for read counts. Cytosine sites having higher
#'     coverage than this are discarded.
#' @param columns Vector of integer numbers of the columns (from each GRanges
#'     meta-column) where the methylated and unmethylated counts are provided.
#'     If not provided, then the methylated and unmethylated counts are assumed
#'     to be at columns 1 and 2, respectively.
#' @param ignore.strand When set to TRUE, the strand information is ignored in
#'     the overlap calculations. Default value: TRUE
#' @param num.cores The number of cores to use, i.e. at most how many child
#'     processes will be run simultaneously (see bplapply function from
#'     BiocParallel package).
#' @param tasks Integer(1). The number of tasks per job. value must be a scalar
#'     integer >= 0L. In this documentation a job is defined as a single call to
#'     a function, such as bplapply, bpmapply etc. A task is the division of the
#'     X argument into chunks. When tasks == 0 (default), X is divided as evenly
#'     as possible over the number of workers (see MulticoreParam from
#'     BiocParallel package).
#' @param verbose if TRUE, prints the function log to stdout
#' @param ... Additional parameters for 'uniqueGRanges' function.
#'
#' @return A GRanges object with the columns of methylated and unmethylated
#'   counts filtered for each cytosine position.
