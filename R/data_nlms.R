#' Simulated dataset of nonlinear fits used in the examples
#'
#' Each individuals sample includes 5000 cytosine positions
#'
#' @format nlms is a list of best fitted nonlinear probability distribution
#'     model estimated for the datset 'HD' (available in MethylIT pacakga)
#'     'nlms' carries the information on the best fitted probability
#'     distribution model for each individual sample. 'nlms' was obtianed with
#'     function \code{\link{nonlinearFitDist}}.
