\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix of counts or GRanges object with the table of counts in
the meta-columns (methylated mC and unmethylated uC cytosines). Unless
specified in the parameter 'columns', the methylation counts must be
given in the first four columns: "mC1" and "uC1" methylated and
unmethylated counts for control sample, and "mC2" and "uC2" methylated
and unmethylated counts for treatment sample, respectively.}

\item{Bayesian}{logical. Whether to perform the estimations based on
posterior estimations of methylation levels.}

\item{JD}{Logic (Default:FALSE). Option on whether to add a column with
values of J-information divergence (see \code{\link{estimateJDiv}}).
It is only compute if JD = TRUE and meth.level = FALSE.}

\item{num.cores}{The number of cores to use, i.e. at most how many child
processes will be run simultaneously (see 'bplapply' function from
BiocParallel package).}

\item{tasks}{integer(1). The number of tasks per job. value must be a scalar
integer >= 0L. In this documentation a job is defined as a single call
to a function, such as bplapply, bpmapply etc. A task is the division of
the X argument into chunks. When tasks == 0 (default), X is divided as
evenly as possible over the number of workers (see MulticoreParam from
BiocParallel package).}

\item{columns}{Vector of integer numbers of the columns where the counts
"mC1", "uC1", "mC2", and "uC2" are in the matrix (default 1 to 4). That
is, the input could have more than 4 columns, but only 4 columns with
the counts are used. if 'meth.level == TRUE', then
columns = c('p1', 'p2').}

\item{meth.level}{logical(1). Methylation levels can be provided in place of
counts.}

\item{preserve.gr}{logical(1). Option of whether to preserve all
the metadata from the original GRanges object.}

\item{logbase}{Logarithm base used to compute the JD (if JD = TRUE).
Logarithm base 2 is used as default (bit unit). Use logbase = exp(1) for
natural logarithm.}

\item{verbose}{if TRUE, prints the function log to stdout}
}
\value{
The input matrix or GRanges object with the four columns of counts
and additional columns. If Bayessian = TRUE, the results are based on
the posterior estimations of methylation levels. 1) p1" and "p2":
methylation levels for control and treatment; 2) "hdiv": Hellinger
divergence; 3) "bay.TV". "TV": total variation TV = p2 - p1 is based
on simple counts
}
\description{
The Information divergence of methylation levels is estimated
using the direct estimation or a Bayesian approach of the methylation
levels. Hellinger divergence is computed as given in reference 1.
}
\details{
For the current version, the Information divergence of methylation
levels is estimated based on Hellinger divergence. If read counts are
provided, then Hellinger divergence is computed as given in the first
formula from Theorem 1 from reference 1. In the present case,\preformatted{hdiv = 2*(n[1] + 1)*(n[2] + 1)*((sqrt(p[1]) - sqrt(p[2]))^2 + (sqrt(1 -
p[1]) - sqrt(1 - p[2]))^2)/(n[1] + n[2] + 2)

where n[1] and n[2] are the coverage for the control and treatment,
respectively. Notice that each row from the matrix of counts correspond
to a single cytosine position and has four values corresponding to "mC1"
and "uC1" (control), and mC2" and "uC2" for treatment.

If the methylation levels are provided in place of counts, then
Hellinger divergence is computed as:
hdiv = (sqrt(p[1]) - sqrt(p[2]))^2 + (sqrt(1 -p[1]) - sqrt(1 - p[2]))^2

This formula assumes that the probability vectors derived from the
methylation levels (p_ij) p_j = c(p_ij, 1 - p_ij) (see function
'estimateHellingerDiv') are an unbiased estimation of the expected one.

\examples{
## The read count data are created
    x <- data.frame(chr = "chr1", start = 1:10,
                    end = 1:10,strand = '*',
                    mC1 = rnbinom(size = 10, mu = 4, n = 500),
                    uC1 = rnbinom(size = 10, mu = 4, n = 500),
                    mC2 = rnbinom(size = 10, mu = 4, n = 500),
                    uC2 = rnbinom(size = 10, mu = 4, n = 500))
    x <- makeGRangesFromDataFrame(x, keep.extra.columns = TRUE)
## Estimation of the information divergences
    hd <- estimateBayesianDivergence(x, JD = TRUE)

## Keep in mind that Hellinger and J divergences are, in general, correlated!
    cor.test(x = as.numeric(hd$hdiv), y = as.numeric(hd$jdiv),
            method = "kendall")

## An example with methylation levels
set.seed(123)
sites = 10
dat = data.frame(chr = "chr1", start = 1:sites,
                 end = 1:sites,strand = '*',
                 m1 = runif(n = sites),
                 m2 = runif(n = sites))
dat =  makeGRangesFromDataFrame(dat, keep.extra.columns = TRUE)
## Transforming the list of data frames into a GRanges object
hd <- estimateBayesianDivergence(x = dat, columns = c(p1 = 1, p2 = 2),
                                 meth.level = TRUE, preserve.gr = TRUE
