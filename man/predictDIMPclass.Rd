\usage{
predictDIMPclass(LR, model, conf.matrix = FALSE, control.names = NULL,
  treatment.names = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{LR}{A list of GRanges objects obtained through the through MethylIT
downstream analysis. Basically, this object is a list of GRanges
containing only differentially methylated position (DMPs). The metacolumn
of each GRanges must contain the columna: Hellinger divergence "hdiv",
total variation "TV", the probability of potential DMP "wprob", which
naturally are added in the downstream analysis of MethylIT.}

\item{model}{A classifier model obtained with the function
'evaluateDIMPclass'.}

\item{conf.matrix}{Optional. Logic, whether a confusion matrix should be
returned (default, FALSE, see below).}

\item{control.names}{Optional. Names/IDs of the control samples, which must
be include in thr variable LR (default, NULL).}

\item{treatment.names}{Optional. Names/IDs of the treatment samples, which
must be include in the variable LR (default, NULL).}
}
\value{
The same LR object with tow new columns named "class" and "posterior"
    added to each GRanges object from LR (default). Based on the model
    prediction each DMP is labeled as control "CT" or as treatment "TT" in
    column "class". Column "posterior" provides, for each DMP, the posterior
    probability that the given DMP can be classified as induced by the
    'treatment' (a treatment DMP).

    Control DMPs classified as 'treatment' are false positives. However, if
    the same cytosine position is classified as 'treatment DMP' in both
    groups, control and treatment, but with higher posterior probability
    in the treatment group, then this would indicate a reinforcement of the
    methylation status in such a position induced by the treatment.

    If "conf.matrix" is TRUE and the arguments control.names and
    treatment.names are provided, then the overall confusion matrix is
    returned.
}
\description{
This function classify each DMP as a control or a treatment
    DMP
}
\details{
Predictions only makes sense if the query DMPs belong to same
    methylation context and derive from an experiment accomplished under the
    same condition set for the DMPs used to build the model.

\examples{

data(cutpoint, PS, package = "MethylIT")

## DMPs are selected using the cupoints
DMPs <- selectDIMP(PS, div.col = 9L, cutpoint = cutpoint$cutpoint,
                   tv.cut = 0.92)

## Classification of DMPs into two clases: DMPS from control and DMPs from
## treatment samples and evaluation of the classifier performance (for more
## details see ?evaluateDIMPclass).
perf <- evaluateDIMPclass(LR = DMPs,
                          column = c(hdiv = TRUE, TV = TRUE,
                                     wprob = TRUE, pos = TRUE),
                          classifier = "lda", n.pc = 4L,
                          control.names =  c("C1", "C2", "C3"),
                          treatment.names = c("T1", "T2", "T3"),
                          center = TRUE, scale = TRUE,
                          prop = 0.6)

#' Now predictions of DMP for control and treament can be obtained
pred = predictDIMPclass(LR = DMPs, model = perf$model,
                        conf.matrix = TRUE,
                        control.names = c("C1", "C2", "C3"),
