\format{HD is an object from class "InfDiv" carrying in the meta-columns the
    following variables:
    \describe{
        \item{p1}{methylation level from the reference sample}
        \item{p2}{methylation level from the treatment sample}
        \item{TV}{the total variation distance (difference of
                methylation levels)}
        \item{hdiv}{Hellinger divergence}
