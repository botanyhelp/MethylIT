\usage{
bootstrap2x2(x, stat = "rmst", num.permut = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numerical matrix corresponding to cross tabulation (2x2) table
(contingency table).}

\item{stat}{Statistic to be used in the testing: 'rmst','hdiv', or "all".}

\item{num.permut}{Number of permutations.}
}
\value{
A p-value probability
}
\description{
Parametric Bootstrap of 2x2 Contingence independence test. The
    goodness of fit statistic is the root-mean-square statistic (RMST) or
    Hellinger divergence, as proposed by Perkins et al. [1, 2]. Hellinger
    divergence (HD) is computed as proposed in [3].
}
\details{
For goodness-of-fit the following null hypothesis is tested
    \eqn{H_\theta: p = p(\theta)}
    To conduct a single simulation, we perform the following three-step
     procedure [1,2]:
\enumerate{
    \item To generate m i.i.d. draws according to the model distribution
          \eqn{p(\theta)}, where \eqn{\theta'} is the estimate calculated
          from the experimental data,
    \item To estimate the parameter \eqn{\theta} from the data generated in
          Step 1, obtaining a new estimate \eqn{\theta}est.
    \item To calculate the statistic under consideration (HD,
          RMST), using the data generated in Step 1 and taking the model
          distribution to be \eqn{\theta}est, where \eqn{\theta}est is the
          estimate calculated in Step 2 from the data generated in Step 1.
}
    After conducting many such simulations, the confidence level for
    rejecting the null hypothesis is the fraction of the statistics
    calculated in step 3 that are less than the statistic calculated from
    the empirical data. The significance level Î± is the same as a confidence
    level of \eqn{1-\alpha}.

\examples{
    set.seed(123)
    TeaTasting = matrix(c(8, 350, 2, 20), nrow = 2,
                        dimnames = list(Guess = c("Milk", "Tea"),
                        Truth = c("Milk", "Tea")))
    ## Small num.permut for test's speed sake
    bootstrap2x2( TeaTasting, stat = "all", num.permut = 100 )
