\arguments{
\item{LR}{An object from 'pDMP' class. This object is previously obtained
with function \code{\link{getPotentialDIMP}}.}

\item{control.names, treatment.names}{Names/IDs of the control and
treatment samples, which must be include in the variable LR.}

\item{simple}{Logic (default, TRUE). If TRUE, then Youden Index is used to
estimate the cutpoint. If FALSE, the minimum information divergence value
with posterior classification probability greater than \emph{post.cut}
(usually \emph{post.cut} = 0.5) as estimated by \emph{classifier1} will
be the reported cutpoint, except if a better cutpoint is found in the set
of values provided by the user in the parameter \emph{cut.values}.}

\item{column}{a logical vector for column names for the predictor variables
to be used: Hellinger divergence "hdiv", total variation "TV",
probability of potential DIMP "wprob", and the relative cytosine site
position "pos" in respect to the chromosome where it is located. The
relative position is estimated as (x - x.min)/(x.max - x), where x.min
and x.max are the maximum and minimum for the corresponding chromosome,
repectively. If "wprob = TRUE", then Logarithm base-10 of "wprob" will
be used as predictor in place of "wprob".}

\item{classifier1, classifier2}{Classification model to use. Option "logistic"
applies a logistic regression model; option "lda" applies a Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA); "qda" applies a Quadratic Discriminant
Analysis (QDA), "pca.logistic" applies logistic regression model using
the Principal Component (PCs) estimated with Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) as predictor variables. pca.lda" applies LDA using PCs as predictor
variables, and the option "pca.qda" applies a Quadratic Discriminant
Analysis (QDA) using PCs as predictor variables. If classifier2 is not
NULL, then it will be used to evaluate the classification performance,
and the corresponding best fitted model will be returned.}

\item{tv.cut}{A cutoff for the total variation distance to be applied to each
site/range. Only sites/ranges \emph{k} with \eqn{TVD_{k} > tv.cut} are
are used in the analysis. Its value must be a number.
\eqn{0 < tv.cut < 1}. Default is \eqn{tv.cut = 0.25}.}

\item{div.col}{Column number for divergence variable for which the estimation
of the cutpoint will be performed.}

\item{clas.perf}{Logic. Whether to evaluate the classification performance
for the estimated cutpoint using a model classifier when 'simple=TRUE'.
Default, FALSE.}

\item{post.cut}{If 'simple=FALSE', this is posterior probability to dicide
whether a DMPs belong to treatment group. Default \emph{post.cut} = 0.5.}

\item{prop}{Proportion to split the dataset used in the logistic regression:
group versus divergence (at DIMPs) into two subsets, training and
testing.}

\item{n.pc}{Number of principal components (PCs) to use if the classifier is
not 'logistic'. In the current case, the maximun number of PCs is 4.}

\item{cut.values}{Cut values of the information divergence (ID) specified  in
\emph{div.col} where to check the classification performance
(0 < \emph{cut.interval} < max ID). If provided, the search for a
cutpoint will include these values.}

\item{stat}{An integer number indicating the statistic to be used in the
 testing when \emph{simple} = FALSE The mapping for statistic names are:
 \itemize{
     \item 0 = "Accuracy"
     \item 1 = "Sensitivity"
     \item 2 = "Specificity"

     \item 9 = "Detection Rate"
     \item 10 = "Detection Prevalence"
     \item 11 = "Balanced Accuracy"
     \item 12 = FDR

\item{num.cores, tasks}{Paramaters for parallele computation using package
\code{\link[BiocParallel]{BiocParallel-package}}: the number of cores to
use, i.e. at most how many child processes will be run simultaneously
(see \code{\link[BiocParallel]{bplapply}} and the number of tasks per job
(only for Linux OS).}

\item{...}{arguments passed to or from other methods.}

\description{
Given a list of two GRanges objects, control and treatment,
    carrying the potential signals (prior classification) from controls and
    treatments in terms of an information divergence
    (given the meta-columns), the function estimates the cutpoints of the
    control group versus treatment group.
}
\details{
The function performs an estimation of the optimal cutpoint for the
    classification of the differentially methylated (cytosines) positions
    into two classes: DMPs from control and DMPs from treatment. The simplest
    approach to estimate the cutpoint  is based on the application of Youden
    Index. More complexes approach based in several machine learning model
    are provided as well.

    Results of the classification perfomance resulting from the estimated
    cutpoint are normally given, with the exception of those extreme
    situations where the statistics to evaluate performance cannot be
    estimated. More than one classifier model can be applied. For example,
    one classifier (logistic model) can be used to estimate the posterior
    classification probabilities of DMP into those from control and those
    from treatment. These probabilities are then used to estimate the
    cutpoint in range of values from, say, 0.5 to 0.8. Next, a different
    classifier can be used to evaluate the classification performance.
    Different classifier models would yield different performances. Models
    are returned and can be used in futher prediction with new datasets from
    the same batch experiment. This is a machine learnig approach to
    discriminate the biological regulatory signal naturally generated in the
    control from that one induced by the treatment.
