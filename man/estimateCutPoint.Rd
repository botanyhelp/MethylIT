with function \code{\link{getPotentialDIMP}}.}

\item{control.names, treatment.names}{Names/IDs of the control and
treatment samples, which must be include in the variable LR.}

\item{simple}{Logic (default, TRUE). If TRUE, then Youden Index is used to
estimate the cutpoint.}

\item{column}{a logical vector for column names for the predictor variables
to be used: Hellinger divergence "hdiv", total variation "TV",
probability of potential DIMP "wprob", and the relative cytosine site
position "pos" in respect to the chromosome where it is located. The
relative position is estimated as (x - x.min)/(x.max - x), where x.min
and x.max are the maximum and minimum for the corresponding chromosome,
repectively. If "wprob = TRUE", then Logarithm base-10 of "wprob" will
be used as predictor in place of "wprob".}

\item{classifier1, classifier2}{Classification model to use. Option "logistic"
applies a logistic regression model; option "lda" applies a Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA); "qda" applies a Quadratic Discriminant
Analysis (QDA), "pca.logistic" applies logistic regression model using
the Principal Component (PCs) estimated with Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) as predictor variables. pca.lda" applies LDA using PCs as predictor
variables, and the option "pca.qda" applies a Quadratic Discriminant
Analysis (QDA) using PCs as predictor variables. If classifier2 is not
NULL, then it will be used to evaluate the classification performance,
and the corresponding best fitted model will be returned.}

\item{tv.cut}{A cutoff for the total variation distance to be applied to each
site/range. Only sites/ranges *k* with \eqn{TVD_{k} > tv.cut} are
are used in the analysis. Its value must be a number.
\eqn{0 < tv.cut < 1}. Default is \eqn{tv.cut = 0.25}.}

of the cutpoint will be performed.}

for the estimated cutpoint using a model classifier when 'simple=TRUE'.

\description{
Given a list of two GRanges objects, control and treatment,
    carrying the potential signals (prior classification) from controls and
    treatments in terms of an information divergence
    (given the meta-columns), the function estimates the cutpoints of the
    control group versus treatment group.
}
\details{
The function performs an estimation of the optimal cutpoint for the
    classification of the differentially methylated (cytosines) positions
    into two classes: DMPs from control and DMPs from treatment. The simplest
    approach to estimate the cutpoint  is based on the application of Youden
    Index. More complexes approach based in several machine learning model
    are provided as well.

    Results of the classification perfomance resulting from the estimated
    cutpoint are normally given, with the exception of those extreme
    situations where the statistics to evaluate performance cannot be
    estimated. More than one classifier model can be applied. For example,
    one classifier (logistic model) can be used to esitmate the posterior
    classification probabilities of DMP into those from control and those
    from treatment. This probabilities are then used to estimate the cutpoint
    in range of values from, say, 0.5 to 0.8. Next, a different classifier
    can be used to evaluate the classification performance. Different
    classifier models would yield different performances. Models are returned
    and can be used in futher prediction with new datasets from the same
    batch experiment. This is a machine learnig approach to discriminate the
    biological regulatory signal naturally generated in the control from that
    one induced by the treatment.
