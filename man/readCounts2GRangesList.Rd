\title{Read files of methylation count tables}
\usage{
readCounts2GRangesList(filenames = NULL, sample.id = NULL,
  pattern = NULL, remove = FALSE, columns = c(seqnames = NULL, start
  = NULL, end = NULL, strand = NULL, fraction = NULL, percent = NULL, mC =
  NULL, uC = NULL, coverage = NULL, context = NULL, seq = NULL),
  chromosome.names = NULL, chromosomes = NULL, contexts = NULL,
  seqs = NULL, verbose = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{filenames}{Character vector with the file names}

\item{sample.id}{Character vector with the names of the samples
corresponding to each file}

\item{pattern}{Chromosome name pattern. Users working on Linux OS can
specify the reading of specific lines from each file by using regular
expressions.}

\item{remove}{Logic (TRUE). Usually the supplementary files from GEO
datasets are 'gz' compressed. File datasets must be decompressed to be
read. The decompressed files are removed after read if this is set
'TRUE'.}

\item{columns}{Vector of integer numbers denoting the table columns that
must be read. The numbers for 'seqnames' (chromosomes), 'start', and
'end' (if different from 'start') columns must be given. The possible
fields are: 'seqnames' (chromosomes),'start', 'end', 'strand',
'fraction', percent' (metylation percentage), 'mC' (methylates cytosine),
'uC' (non methylated cytosine), 'coverage', and 'context'
(methylation context). These column headers are not required to be in the
files.}

\item{chromosome.names}{If provided, for each GRanges object, chromosome
names will be changed to those provided in 'chromosome.names' applying
seqlevels(x) <- chromosome.names'. This option permits to use all the
functionality of the function "seqlevels" defined from package
"GenomeInfoDb", which rename, add, and reorder the seqlevels all at once
(see ?seqlevels).}

\item{chromosomes}{If provided, it must be a character vector with the names
of the chromosomes that you want to include in the final GRanges objects.}

\item{contexts}{If provided, it must be a character vector with the names
of the contexts that you want to include in the final GRanges objects, 
for example, "CG", "CHG"}

\item{seqs}{If provided, it must be a character vector with the names
of the trinucleotide sequences that you want to include in the final 
GRanges objects, for example, "CGA", "CAA"}

\item{verbose}{If TRUE, prints the function log to stdout}

\item{...}{Additional parameters for 'fread' function from 'data.table'
package}
}
\value{
A list of GRanges objects
}
\description{
This function is addressed to read files with methylation count
    table data commonly generated after the alignment of BS-seq data or found
    in GEO database
}
\details{
Read tables from files with a table methylation count data using
    the function fread from the package 'data.table' and and yields a list of
    GRanges objects with the information provided.
