Overview
--------

We have developed a novel methylome analysis procedure, Methyl-IT, based on information thermodynamics and signal detection. Methylation analysis involves a signal detection problem, and the method was designed to discriminate methylation regulatory signal from background noise induced by thermal fluctuations. Our group \[[1](#1),[2](#2)\] has proposed an information thermodynamics approach to investigate genome-wide methylation patterning based on the statistical mechanical effect of methylation on DNA molecules. The information thermodynamics-based approach is postulated to provide greater sensitivity for resolving true signal from the thermodynamic background within the methylome \[[1](#1)\]. Because the biological signal created within the dynamic methylome environment characteristic of plants is not free from background noise, the approach, designated Methyl-IT, includes an application of signal detection theory.

A basic requirement for the application of signal detection is the knowledge of the background noise probability distribution. A Weibull probability distribution model can be deduced on a statistical mechanical/thermodynamics basis for DNA methylation induced by thermal fluctuations \[[1](#1)\]. Assuming that this background methylation variation is consistent with a Poisson process, it can be distinguished from variation associated with methylation regulatory machinery, which is non-independent for all genomic regions \[[1](#1)\]. An information-theoretic divergence to express the variation in methylation induced by background thermal fluctuations will follow a Weibull distribution model, provided that it is proportional to minimum energy dissipated per bit of information from methylation change. The information thermodynamics model was previously verified with more than 150 Arabidopsis and more than 90 human methylome datasets \[[3](#3)\].

With Methyl-IT R package we are providing the functions from the R scripts used in the manuscript \[[3](#3)\], as well as, additional functions that will be used in further studies. The application of the information thermodynamics of cytosine DNA methylation is not limited to the current methylome analysis, which is only a particular application. The theory permits us the study of plant and animal methylomes in the framework of a communication system \[[1](#1)\], where cytosine DNA methylation has the dual roles of stabilizing the DNA molecule and to carry the regulatory signals.
