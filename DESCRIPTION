Description: Methyl-IT implements methylation analysis based on signal detection
             theory and machine-learning. Methylation process is a stochastic
             process, particularly, a biochemical-biophysical process which must
             not be reduced to statistic. Methyl-IT includes the information on
             the statistical biophysics of the methylation process with the 
             estimation of the probability distribution of the noise 
             (plus signal), which is expressed in terms of information 
             divergences.
